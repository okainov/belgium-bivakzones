# Bivakzone / free camping in Belgium

This is a simple script to get coordinates in GPX format of free wild camping places (so called "bivakzones" in Belgium) in Belgium from wonderful [bivakzone.be](https://bivakzone.be/overzichtskaart.html) website and map.

if everything is ok, you should be able to get GPX with ~56 points (at the time of writing in June 2022)
